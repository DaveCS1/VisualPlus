! NOTICE !

MY TIME AND PRIORITIES HAVE SHIFTED THAT I CANNOT GIVE THIS PROJECT AS MUCH LOVE ANYMORE AS I USED TO FIX ALL THE ISSUES IT CONTAINS THAT IT REQUIRES A REBUILD #3? (I'm always learning and mostly self-taught) DUE TO HOW I SETUP SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURE FROM THE START AND MY PRJOECT FILE MAY HAVE BEEN ALSO CORRUPTED SOMEWHERE WITH RANDOM WHITESPACES IN MY THEME FILES, THE UI DESIGNER JUST FREEZES UP VISUAL STUDIO. AND I HAVE TO FORCE RESTART VISUAL STUDIO. THIS MAKES DEBUGGING IT A NIGHTMARE DUE TO NO FEEDBACK AND DESIGNER FILES FAILING TO UPDATE FAILING TO SHOW IT IN THE ERROR LOG USING 'Try-Catch or WriteLine' to Console in the 'Initializers' NOT EVEN REPORTING FEEDBACK IN ERROR LOGS.

ANY FEEDBACK ON HOW TO DEBUG SUCH '*.DESIGNER.cs' ISSUES WITHOUT VISUAL-STUDIO COMMITTING SUICIDE PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME BY JUST LEAVING AN ISSUE REPORT!

I AM COMMITS AHEAD OF THIS VERSION BUT ITS LESS STABLE AND THEREFORE NOT UPLOADING IT TO AVOID BREAKING IT FURTHER. ALSO I DON'T LIKE THAT SOME CHANGES ARE NECESSARY BUT BROKE PROJECTS USING IT THEN OR EVEN ITS OWN INTERNAL COMPONENTS SINCE SOME TOOLS HAVE MULI-COMPONENTS INTERFACING TOGETHER EACH CAN BE THEME WHEN ITS JUST ONE LITTLE THING IT THEN THE WHOLE CHAIN IS BROKEN. THIS IS WHY I KEEP IT IN A BETA STAGE UNTIL I LEARN TO DO IT RIGHT AND IS AS STABLE AS POSSIBLE. LOOKING THROUGH THE CODE THERE ARE MANY FLAWS (~125 BUGS TODO ON MY PERSONAL LIST).

AS MUCH AS SOME OF YOU LIKE USING THIS API TO PIMP UP YOUR UI APPLICATIONS QUICKLY. I NEED IT ALSO SO I HAVE BEGAN MIGRATING BASIC ESSENTIAL ONLY TOOLS AND COMPONENTS TO MY PRIVATE PROJECTS MEANWHILE TO REMAIN PRODUCTIVE AND KEEP LEARNING OTHER AREAS OF .NET BUT THEIR NO WHERE NEAR AS COMPLEX AS SOME OF THESE TOOLS JUST VERY VERY BASIC ESSENTIALS AND DOING MINOR OPTIMIZATIONS TO ONE DAY BRING BACK AGAIN TO THIS REPOSITORY ALONG WITH UNIT TESTS.

THERE FOR THIS REPOSITORY WILL REMAIN ONLINE FOR ANYONE TO CLONE, FORK OR DOWNLOAD FOR THEMSELVES AND LEARN FROM IT TO DO AS THEY PLEASE. ONCE I HAVE REBUILT IT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE GAINED OVER THE YEARS AND ALL THE FEEDBACK I HAVE COLLECTED TO ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL OF AND FEATURES AS THIS MINUS THE BUGS. I WILL RE-UPLOAD A BRAND NEW VERSION HERE ON THIS SAME REPOSITORY!

THIS WAS MY FIRST REPOSITORY JUST TO LEARN AND GAIN FEEDBACK UNDERSTAND HOW GIT WORKS WITH GITHUB. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE ⭐ STARS ⭐ AND FEEDBACK THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED AND HAS HELPED ME GROW INTO A BETTER DEVELOPER I AM TODAY AND EVOLVED THE PROJECT TO MORE THAN I ORIGINALLY EXPECTED. YOU MAY HAVE ALSO NOTICED I SHUTDOWN THE DISCORD CHANNEL TO CANCEL SUPPORT FOR THIS VERSION.

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING AND TEACHING ME FROM YOUR FEEDBACK TO BE A BETTER CODER AND REALLY APPRECIATED THE KIND COMMENTS I GET ON DISCORD FOR SUPPORT. VISUAL-PLUS WILL BE BACK AGAIN BUT BETTER TO HOW I HAD ENVISIONED IT. I JUST DONT LIKE BREAKING PROJECTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
