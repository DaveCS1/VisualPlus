**Expected behavior**:
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Environment (please complete the following information)**:
- VisualPlus version [e.g. v0.4.0.1]

- Visual Studio [e.g. 2017 v15.7.1]

**Note**:
Please fill the following guidelines out as best as you can, as that will most likely result me looking at the issue sooner.
- You may also post a full GitHub repository forked. Just not a zip file or half-baked snippet/s etc. If GitHub is new to you consider it a great learning opportunity and chance to get involved.
- The repository should have just ONE-step max for me to get running, and that is "Restore NuGet Packages". If there are any other missing dependencies, or uncompiling features I will most likely move on to another issue.

**Additional context**:
